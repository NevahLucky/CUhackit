Description: Hello there, welcome to our CUhackit project.
We decided to tackle the sustainability and game categories by making a tower defense game.
Its inspiration stems from the mass deforestation of our planet, forcing habitat loss for various creatures.
The allies are different animal species and the enemies are humans with tools for deforestation. 
Our game is designed in godot, a free 2D and 3D game engine.

Takeaways:
- Creating a well thought through plan increases efficiency and provides a reliable guideline in decision making
- Delegation of tasks and trust of teammates to complete their roles is essential to teamwork
- When put under time crunch, and even without, focus on the most important tasks is vital
- Communication within the team creates productive workflows focused on completing the main goal
- Debugging small portions of code is far more efficient then untagling a full program worth of errors
- Consistent saves using git is a best practice, allowing you to visualize current progress and divide tasks into smaller steps
